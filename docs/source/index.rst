PyPond - Python Pond timeseries library.
========================================

Overview
--------

PyPond is a Python implementation of the JavaScript `Pond timeseries
library <http://software.es.net/pond/>`__. At a very high level, both
implementations offer classes and structures to collect, manipulate and
transmit timeseries data. Time series transmission is done via a
JSON-based wire format.

This implementation is `available on
GitHub <https://github.com/esnet/pypond>`__ and the API documentation is
available at `software.es.net <http://software.es.net/pypond/>`__ (and
alternately on `RTD <http://pypond.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__).

PyPond runs on python 2.7 and 3.3 through 3.6.

Core Documentation
------------------

The `main project site <http://software.es.net/pond/>`__ has extensive
documentation on the various structures (Event, TimeRange, TimeSeries,
etc) that both implementations use internally. There is no need to
duplicate that conceptual documentation here since the python
implementation follows the same API and uses the same structures.

The only real difference with pypond is that the method names have been
changed to their obvious pythonic corollaries (``obj.toString()``
becomes ``obj.to_string()``) and any comparison methods named ``.is()``
in the JavaScript version have been renamed to ``.same()`` in pypond
since ``is`` is a reserved word in python.

The `tests <https://github.com/esnet/pypond/tree/master/tests>`__ can
also be referred to as a fairly complete set of examples as well.
